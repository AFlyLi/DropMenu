# Drop Menu

A custom menu implementation with a slide in menu similar to Medium's menu.

Inspired by [RBMenu](https://github.com/RoshanNindrai/RBMenu) and [Medium](https://github.com/pixyzehn/MediumMenu).


To see how it works, have a look at the Examples folder.

This has not been designed to be dropped into a project as it is, a bit of re-working must be done. I will set it up as an independent component soon.
